# Capstone-project
The online sector has been slowly eating up market share in the past two decades. E-commerce platforms like Unicorn allow people to buy products online: from books, toys, clothes, and shoes to food, furniture, and other household items. 

In this project, I analyzed the data, found interesting insights and identify weak areas and opportunities for Unicorn to boost business growth.
